In this project, I created a Docker container with a node and redis server to host a web page. The main function of the web page is to count the number of hosts that visited the server. 

Here below is a brief description of each of the files.

Dockerfile: 
- To create the image to serve as a base for the docker containers

index.js
- The application server code

package.json
- Install dependencies
